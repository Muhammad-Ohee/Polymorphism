We need to develop an application to calculate bonuses based on the designation of the Employees. The management team has decided to give 50000 as a fixed bonus or based only salary they may get 20% or 25% as bonus whichever is higher. Here, we are taking the example of three different designations, but you can take as many as per your requirement.

If the designation is Developer, then the employee gets either 50000 or 20% of the Salary as a bonus (whichever is higher).
If the designation is Manager, then the employee gets either 50000 or 25% of the Salary as a bonus (whichever is higher).
If the designation is Admin, then the employee will get a fixed 50000 as a bonus.
