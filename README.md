# Polymorphism

The word polymorphism is derived from two Greek words: poly and morphs. The word “Poly” means many, and “morphs” means forms. Therefore, polymorphism means “many forms” or we can say that the word polymorphism means the ability to take more than one form. That is one thing that can take many forms.

Technically, we can say that when a function shows different behaviors when we pass different types and numbers of input values, then it is called Polymorphism in C#. So, behaving in different ways depending on the input received is known as polymorphism, i.e., whenever the input changes, automatically, the output or the behavior also changes.
